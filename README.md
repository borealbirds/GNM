# GNM

> Generalized National Models

- Data processing: make BCR specific data bundles (observations, offsets, and predictors)
- BRT code: predictor set specific to BCRs otherwise generic code
- HPC runs: use Compute Canada resources to run species x BCR models (bootstrap depending on timings?)
- Prediction: mosaic together the BCR pieces
- Basic web (?) app to deliver key results

What are key results?

- BCR level predictive maps by species (1 km2 res rasters)
- maps as images
- Mean density by land cover
- Pop size by region
- partial dependence plots & variable importance rankings
